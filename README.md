# A SIMPLE TODO WEBSITE - Group Assignment

## Introduction

Welcome to our group assignment for creating a simple TODO website! In this project, we will be developing JavaScript code to implement a TODO list with dynamic task management functionalities.

The purpose of this repository is to provide a practical demonstration of how to build a TODO website using JavaScript. We will be focusing on key tasks such as querying for elements, enabling/disabling buttons, handling user input, and dynamically updating the task list.

To accomplish our goals, we will make use of the `createElement` function to create HTML elements and the `append` function to add them to the DOM. By leveraging these functions, we can dynamically generate and update the task list based on user input.

## The Problem

1. Query for the submit button and input task field once in the beginning and store those two values in the variables `submit` and `newTask`.
2. Disable the submit button by default. Enable/disable it by setting its `disabled` attribute to `false` or `true`.
3. Listen for input to be typed into the input field.
4. Listen for the submission of the form.
5. Find the task that the user just submitted.
6. Create a list item for the new task and add the task to it.
7. Add the new element to our unordered list.
8. At the end of the script, add the line `return false`. This prevents the default submission of the form, which involves either reloading the current page or redirecting to a new one.

Please note that HTML elements should be created using the `createElement` function, and elements should be added to the DOM using the `append` function.

## Screenshots

Here are a few screenshots of the TODO application in action:
